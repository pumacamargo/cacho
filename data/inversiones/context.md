# 🧭 2026 Investment Context — Complete Guide

## 📊 Strategic Portfolio Allocation 2026

### ⚠️ Macroeconomic Context

**Critical Concern**: Risk of global recession and concurrent devaluation of US dollar and Japanese yen.

**Implications**:
- **Weak dollar** → USD assets lose value in other currencies, but improves competitiveness of US exporters
- **Weak yen** → Japan maintains competitive exports, but reduces purchasing power of Japanese investors
- **Possible recession** → Risk assets volatile, strength in defensives and commodities
- **Response**: Multi-currency and multi-asset diversification to reduce concentrated devaluation risk

This portfolio structure is specifically designed to **resist these adverse macro scenarios**.

### ✅ Target Verification (Optimized)

#### Current Status vs Target

| Category | Total | % Real | Target | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Productive Assets** | 90k | 39.3% | 40% | ✅ Very close |
| **REITs/Real** | 32k | 14% | 15% | ✅ Very close |
| **Metals/Commodities** | 45k | 19.7% | 20% | ✅ Almost exact |
| **Cash + CETES** | 57.5k | 25.1% | 20% | ⚠️ +5% (defensive intentional) |
| **Crypto** | 8k | 3.5% | 5% | ✅ Conservative |
| **Emerging Markets** | 10k | 4.4% | — | ✅ Included |

#### 🤔 Why Cash is 5% Above Target

**Strategic reason: 2026 macro context**

- Possible recession → having "dry powder" is critical
- 15k CAD liquid + 40k CETES = maximum flexibility
- If market drops 20-30%, you use this cash to buy cheap
- Document says: "In recession: cash is king"

**Alternative if you prefer exact target (20%)**:
- Reduce liquid cash: 15k → 7k (frees 8k)
- Increase gold: 25k → 30k (+5k)
- Increase crypto: 5k → 8k (+3k)
- Result: Cash: 47.5k (20.7%) ✅ | Commodities: 50k (21.8%) ✅

## 🎯 Central Thesis

We are in structural change, not cyclical:

- **AI is like electricity**: transforms everything and is here to stay.
- **Second derivative is where money is**: physical infrastructure, energy and critical chains, not just software.
- **Many winners already ran up** → timing and selection matter more than hype.

---

## 📊 Analysis of Key Sectors

### 🤖 AI and Infrastructure

Strong investment isn't in "AI apps", but in:

- **Semiconductors** (equipment > designers)
- **Data centers, networks and memory (HBM)**

**⚠️ Real risk**: overcapacity 2027–2028 after years of CAPEX.

**⚠️ Risk #1**: US–China geopolitics and supply chain dependence.

**Better approach**: equipment manufacturers + well-diversified ETFs.

---

### 🔋 Energy (the real bottleneck)

AI consumes brutal amounts of energy and current grid can't handle it.

**Structural winners**:
- Electrical grid, transformers, cables
- Nuclear (including SMRs) for 24/7 energy
- Natural gas as bridge fuel (2025–2028), though unglamorous

**Key raw materials**:
- **Copper and uranium** → correct trend, but advanced cycle → wait for pullbacks.

---

### 🏥 Biotech, Digital Health and Longevity

Sector beaten down in price, but fundamentals intact.

**Catalysts**:
- AI in drug discovery
- GLP-1 (obesity/metabolic)
- Genetics, CRISPR and AI diagnostics

**Better route**: biotech ETFs or public companies with real revenue.

---

### 🔐 Cybersecurity and Digital Defense

Non-discretionary spending (even in recession).

**Pillars**:
- Zero Trust, digital identity and cloud security are mandatory.
- Cybersecurity defense grows with geopolitical tensions.
- Premium valuation, but justified by necessity.

---

### 🏗️ Data Centers, Edge and Cloud Sovereignty

Infrastructure is the "road" of AI.

**Key trends**:
- Data centers and REITs
- Liquid cooling
- Edge computing

**Data Sovereignty**:
- Countries demand citizen data stays locally.
- Benefits regional clouds and local data centers.
- Challenges AWS / Google / Azure outside USA.

---

### 🚗 Electric Mobility

Solid trend, but without euphoria.

**Opportunities**:
- Batteries
- Charging infrastructure
- Critical components

**Better route**: Ecosystem ETFs, not individual OEMs.

---

### 🧬 Future Technologies (high risk)

Quantum, 6G, aerospace: transformative but long.

**⚠️ Very sensitive to high rates and credit cycle.**

**Prefer**:
- Public companies
- Diversified ETFs
- Avoid "promise-only" bets

---

## ⚠️ Structural Risks to Monitor

- **Semiconductor overcapacity** (2027–2028)
- **Geopolitics > valuations**
- **High rates** = punishment for deeptech startups
- **ETF overlap**: false diversification (lots of MSFT / NVIDIA repeated)

---

## 🧠 Rules of Gold

- ✔️ Timing > narrative
- ✔️ Infrastructure > software
- ✔️ Public with revenue > startups burning cash
- ✔️ Real signals > predictions
- ✔️ Real geographic diversification (India, Europe, Asia)
- ✔️ 3–5 year horizon

---

## 🏆 Strategic Priorities (5 years)

1. **Digital infrastructure** (data centers, cooling)
2. **Energy** (nuclear + electrical grid + gas bridge)
3. **Semiconductors** (equipment)
4. **Health + AI**
5. **Zero Trust Cybersecurity**

---

## 📌 Key Alert Signals to Monitor

- **ASML guidance down > 5%** → imminent overcapacity
- **HBM prices fall > 20% Y/Y** → memory oversupply
- **New TSMC sanctions** → critical geopolitical risks
- **Natural gas < $2/MMBTU** → producers cut CAPEX
- **High yield spreads > 600 bps** → market in risk-off

---

## 🔄 OPERATIONAL RULES

### 📅 Quarterly Rebalancing

**Timing**: First Friday of each quarter

**Rebalancing Triggers**:
- If any category deviates **> 5%** from target
- If crypto rises > 50% → sell partial and take profits
- If gold rises > 30% → consider taking profits
- Special: If alert signal triggers → rebalance immediately

**How to execute**:
1. Calculate current % of each position
2. Identify what's above/below target
3. Sell winners (above target)
4. Buy losers or hold cash (below target)
5. Document transactions

---

### 🚨 Alert Signals — Action Table

| Signal | Status | Action |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **ASML guidance -5%** | ⚠️ | Reduce semis 18k → 12k, increase cash |
| **HBM prices -20% Y/Y** | 🔴 | Overcapacity confirmed, rotate to defensives |
| **Gas < $2/MMBTU** | ⚠️ | Sell natural gas, buy more gold |
| **High yield spreads > 600bps** | 🔴 | Risk-off: sell biotech, buy utilities |
| **Recession confirmed** | 🔴 | Use 15k cash to buy discounted tech |
| **Yen < 170** | ✅ | Increase exporters in Japan account |
| **Dollar very weak** | ✅ | Increase CETES, reduce direct USD |

---

### 💰 Tactical Cash Use

**Buying scenarios**:

- **Market drops 20%** → Use 5k cash to buy tech cheap
- **Dollar weakens strongly** → Increase CETES (MXN strengthens)
- **Yen weakens more (>165)** → Add exporters in Japan account
- **Gold strong rally (+25%)** → Take partial profits → cash

**Limits**:
- Never invest 100% of cash in one event
- Always keep 5k CAD liquid for emergencies
- If drop > 30%, wait for confirmation of 2-3 signals

---

### 🎯 Suggested Annual Calendar

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Each month** | Monitor alert signals (ASML, HBM, spreads) |
| **Each quarter (1Q, 2Q, 3Q, 4Q)** | Rebalance per deviations |
| **Every 6 months** | Review macro thesis (recession, geopolitics) |
| **Annually** | Deep analysis, strategic adjustments |

### 🇲🇽 Mexico — The "Dry Powder" (CETES)

#### 🎯 Strategy: CETES Laddering

**Why CETES**:
- Real yield: 7-9% annually (only investment that beats MXN inflation)
- Safe liquidity if there's panic (you can always sell)
- Your insurance against global recession

#### 📊 Recommended Laddering Structure

| Maturity | % of Cash | Amount | Reason |
|----------|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Bondia (overnight)** | 30% | 12k CAD | Immediate liquidity, emergencies |
| **CETES 28 days** | 20% | 8k CAD | Quick rotation, reinvestment |
| **CETES 91 days** | 30% | 12k CAD | Balance between rate and liquidity |
| **CETES 182 days** | 20% | 8k CAD | Maximum rate, lock in yield |

**Goal**: You have access to ~12k CAD monthly (Bondia + 28d rotation) to rebalance without touching long-term.

#### 🏦 Recommended Platforms

1. **Cetesdirecto** (official government platform)
   - Requirement: Mexican RFC
   - Commission: 0% (direct from government)
   - Best for: Mexican residents

2. **GBM+** (accepts foreigners)
   - Requirement: Valid ID
   - Commission: Very low (~0.05%)
   - Best for: Canadians, permanent residents in Mexico

#### 📋 Taxes: CETES in Mexico

**Key point**: SAT (Mexican Tax Authority) automatically withholds ISR (income tax).

- **Automatic withholding**: 19.6% on earned interest
- **Final payment**: No need to declare CETES on annual tax return
- **Reporting**: GBM+ or Cetesdirecto report directly to SAT

**If you're a non-resident in Mexico**:
- Still the same: automatic 19.6% tax
- Doesn't affect your immigration status
- Only pays ISR on interest (not on initial capital)

---

### 🇯🇵 Japan — The Dependent Loophole

#### 🎯 Strategy: Register Your Mom as Dependent

**Why it works**: Japan allows you to deduct ¥380,000 (~3,000 CAD) in taxes for each foreign dependent you support, even if they don't live with you.

#### 📋 Requirements (Kakutei Shinkoku — Japanese Tax Return)

1. **Minimum annual transfer**: ¥380,000 (~3,000 CAD) to your mom's name
   - Via Wise, TransferWise, or bank
   - Must be documented

2. **Required documents**:
   - Your mom's passport
   - Bank transfer receipts (proof of sustainability)
   - Affidavit stating you support her (Spanish + Japanese translation)

3. **Submission**:
   - Kakutei Shinkoku (Japanese tax declaration)
   - Submit at municipal tax office before March 15

#### 💰 Estimated Tax Savings

- Deduction: ¥380,000
- Tax savings: ~¥150,000–200,000 (~1,200–1,600 CAD)
- **ROI**: Transfer 3,000, save 1,200-1,600 in taxes = 40-50% return

#### ⚠️ DON'T Try This in Mexico

- As a non-resident in Mexico, dependent deductions for Mexican family members don't work
- Better: Only declare her in Japan (where it actually works)
- Mexico can ignore foreign dependents if you're not paying Mexican ISR

---

### 🇨🇦 Canada — RRSP/TFSA (Complete Inactivity)

#### 🎯 Strategy: Don't Sell Anything

**Why**: As long as money remains INSIDE RRSP/TFSA, there's no taxation. Compound interest works tax-free.

#### 📋 Rules of Gold (RRSP)

| Action | Tax | Note |
|--------|-----|------|
| **Contribute** | 0% | Tax deductible if Canadian resident |
| **Grow** | 0% | No capital gains tax |
| **Rebalance inside** | 0% | Sell/buy without tax |
| **Withdraw money** | Yes | Treated as regular income |

**Strategy**:
- Let capital grow 3-5 years untouched
- If you need money, USE the 15k CAD Cash account instead of touching RRSP
- Only withdraw from RRSP when: confirmed recession OR real emergency

#### 📋 Rules of Gold (TFSA)

| Action | Tax | Note |
|--------|-----|------|
| **Contribute** | 0% | No deduction (but fully tax-free) |
| **Grow** | 0% | Completely tax-free |
| **Withdraw** | 0% | No penalty whatsoever |
| **Reinvest space** | 0% | Space returns next year |

**Strategy**:
- It's your "aggressive account" without tax guilt
- Gain 50% on crypto → 0% taxes in Canada
- Lose 30% on biotech → recover without pressure

#### 🔐 CRA Protection (Canadian Tax Agency)

**Key**: Register as **non-resident** with your broker

- CRA doesn't monitor non-residents' RRSP/TFSA
- As long as you don't sell or withdraw to Canada
- If you live in Japan and your money grows in Canada = invisible to CRA

**Limit**:
- Don't try to deduct RRSP contributions if non-resident
- Only works if you move to Canada (then it's deductible)

---

### 🛡️ Devaluation and Recession Hedge

#### Scenario 1: Dollar Falls (Weak USD/CAD)

**Your protection**:
- ✅ 40k CETES (Mexican pesos) — rise when dollar weakens
- ✅ 5k Crypto (Bitcoin) — inverse to weak dollar
- ❌ Risk: Your RRSP stocks fall in dollars, but hold in CAD

**Action**: Increase CETES if dollar drops < 1.30 CAD/USD

---

#### Scenario 2: Yen Falls (Weak JPY)

**Your protection**:
- ✅ Canadian stocks (USD/CAD) — gain vs JPY
- ✅ Japanese exporters (Toyota, Sony) — benefit from weak yen
- ✅ 40k CETES in MXN — uncorrelated with yen

**Action**: Increase exporters in Japan account if yen drops < 170 JPY/USD

---

#### Scenario 3: Stock Market Crashes (Global Recession)

**Your buffer**:
- 💰 **44% in safe cash**: 40k CETES + 15k CAD liquid
- This 44% lets you buy cheap when panic sells

**Breakdown**:
```
Total: 229k CAD
- CETES: 40k (17.5%)
- Cash CAD: 15k (6.5%)
- Gold: 25k (11%)
- Silver: 5k (2%)
- Gas: 4k (1.7%)
= 89k (38.9%) in non-correlated assets
+ 15k liquid cash = 44% ready for emergencies
```

**Action during recession**:
1. Market drops 20-25%: Use 5k cash to buy tech cheap
2. Market drops 30-35%: Use 10k cash to load semiconductors/biotech
3. Market drops 40%+: Use 15k cash (maximum) if 2-3 alert signals confirmed

---

### 📅 Annual Fiscal Calendar

| Month | Action | Jurisdiction |
|-------|--------|---|
| **Jan-Feb** | Collect CETES documents, mom's transfers | Mexico + Japan |
| **March 15** | File Kakutei Shinkoku (Japanese tax return) | Japan |
| **Apr-May** | File SAT declaration if Mexico resident (optional) | Mexico |
| **June** | Review positions, rebalance if needed | Global |
| **Sept** | Plan Q4, verify taxes paid | Global |
| **Dec** | Close-out: take profits if applicable, plan next year | Global |

---

### 🎯 Monthly Operational Checklist

- [ ] **Japan**: Did mom's transfer go through this month? (if applicable)
- [ ] **Mexico**: Are CETES renewing per ladder schedule?
- [ ] **Canada**: Is RRSP/TFSA balance accurate?
- [ ] **Global**: Any alert signals activated?
- [ ] **Liquidity**: Is at least 5k CAD available liquid?
